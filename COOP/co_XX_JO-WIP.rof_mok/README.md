# Operation Ship Plane

## Mission Description

Scandinavian coalition, composed of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish forces prepares to retake the island occupied by North Korea.

## Briefing

North Korea invaded Russian island under Danish control in Gulf of Finland. No one knows how they managed to get there unnoticed, how they smuggled 3 frigates and an aircraft carrier to Baltic Sea, and even how the hell did they get an aircraft carrier.

Scandinavian coalition, composed of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish forces prepares to retake the island. Danes prepared a frigate, a F-16 and an infantry squad, Norwegians added their F-16 and an infantry squad and Swedes fielded 2 Blackhawks and 2 infantry squads. Together they will face Hu Ju Son's fleet with the task of retaking the island and finding answers to the questions bothering us.

### Tasks

1. Capture the airfield and nearby island
   1. Destroy comms tower
   2. Destroy AA
   3. Destroy Anti Ship batteries
2. Set up a field HQ at the airfield (optional)
   1. Hospital
   2. Service point
   3. Armory
3. Locate the 3 artifacts
   1. Cing jug
   2. Cing bowl
   3. Cing water pipe
4. Neutralize Hu Ju Son's fleet
   1. Sink frigates
   2. Neutralize the aircraft carrier

### Execution

Infantry starts splitted. 2 squads start on the coast of the island with the airfield (they form a first group), the remaining 2 start on a small island to the east (they are a second group). First group should remain silent until the second group destroys the comms tower, which will disable the communications of the airfield with the main island. After that both groups must eliminate all hostiles on both islands, taking control of them. When AA is eliminated, the air assets can enter their vehicles and start from an aircraft carrier.

When airfield is secured, helicopters may deliver the boxes (which are on the aircraft carrier) which can be used to build the field HQ. They should load the boxes inside the helicopters through ACE Cargo instead of using sling loading, otherwise they may unrecoverably lose the cargo mid-flight and some parts of the field HQ may be not available.

After regrouping and rearming you need to start the search for the artifacts on the main island. You might have found some intel at the airfield or the neighboring island, which may point you to the first spot (or tell you where not to search). You may use the planes for recon (as long as they are still alive), focus on interesting points like buildings, don't look in the middle of nowhere. Follow the intel you find along the mission (if any).

During whole mission there is a navy you need to be aware of. Norht Koreans have few frigates and they might be anywhere. You will need to destroy them.
