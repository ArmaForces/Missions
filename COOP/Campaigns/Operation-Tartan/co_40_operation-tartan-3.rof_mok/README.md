## Briefing

Southern Scotland, 2014

British Armed Forces attempted to regain control over Mull of Kintyre peninsula. Reinforcements for remains of the morning landing managed to reach Southend on time and together they witheld Southend. Unfortunately, due to heavy artillery shelling, the town was leveled to the ground.

Platoons formed new task force and were assigned task of securing villa 3 km west of Southend. Intelligence reported that it might be unvaluable source of new data that might help reveal enemy locations and plans.

After initial success and reaching villa, company was surprised by reinforcements from nearby FOB. 30 minutes long firefight started, that only BBC journalists made their way out of, due to heroic cover by Royal Army Soldiers.

Highly armed airborne unit is reaching the area now. Their task will be to neutralize enemy air defence and introduce chaose behind enemy lines.

HMS Cup O'Tea will still provide fire support for the mission using artillery and cruise missiles.

### Tasks

1. Hack 3 AA radars
2. Eliminate any SAMs that are encountered (optional)

### Execution

You need to act fast, do not give enemy time to react. Land fast and close, hit precisely and without warning. Near radars do not use explosive weapons to reduce the risk of damage to either terminal or radar array itself. Those radars will be crucial in securing airspace of the south of the peninsula.

Each of the radars will have terminal somewhere near the antenna. Start the upload of new control program as early as possible. Watch out to not destroy the control panel or the radar itself. After the radar is hacked, run as fast as you can. You don't need to guard it.

Order in which you secure radars is not important.
