## Briefing

Southern Scotland, 2014

British Armed Forces lost control over Mull of Kintyre peninsula. The area was secured without a single shot, the command has no idea what happened. Despite no contact with local radars crew, we've managed to confirm the radars are still working, effectively preventing us from performing safe aerial reconnaisance mission. Shortly before the landing, small recon team was sent to infiltrate the area and provide intel about current situation. Your task depends on their performance.

Your task force consists of 3 motorized teams (Alpha-Charlie), motorized support team (Delta) and 2 airborne infantry squads (Echo + Foxtrot) with Wildcat Royal Navy helicopters (November 1 + 2). You will land on the southern part of the peninsula, using the landing barges. Destroyer HMS Cup O' Tea will provide fire support with its artillery cannon and cruise missiles.

Your main objective is Southend town and its immediate neighbourhood, including hills to the northwest of the town. Capturing the hills will give you control over a vast area to the west, north and east. If possible, after securing Southend area, proceed to villa and secure it, including any possible intel nad high ranked officers.

### Tasks

3. Secure Villa Area
   1. Neutralize enemy camps

### Execution

Mission is split in 2 phases.

1. Reconnaisance
2. Landing

It's strongly advised to play both phases independently to avoid organization problems. Had people who did the reconnaisance die during the mission, they cannot share any information beside the things that went through the radio. They're still permitted to play the second part, albeit not taking any commanding slots if they died.

#### Reconnaisance

Recon team inserts 90 minutes before the landing begins. Their task is to gather as much intelligence about enemy forces around Southend area as possible. They must stay undetected for the whole duration of the mission, otherwise they're doomed as there is no one to help them.

Radio silence is not optional as the enemy might triangulate their position. It's only permitted in emergency situations and when requesting evac. Comms must be as short as possible to minimize detection threat.

#### Landing

Infantry lands south east of Southend using barges. Shortly after there's expected contact from enemy land coast patrol. Following actions are decided by HQ based on the tasks and recon's findings.

Landing will be supported by 2 armed Wildcats. Pilots are advised extreme caution during the operation as the enemy operates multiple SAM launchers in the area.
