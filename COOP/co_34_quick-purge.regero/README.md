# Quick Purge

## Mission Description

US Army tasked to capture Very Important Dude attempts daring drop from C-17.

## Briefing

Kingdom of Regero, 2019

Local regime is a bunch of bad guys doing ugly business that needs to be taken care of. Command nominated 7 targets in the province that must be accomplished as fast as possible. Unfortunately we don't know where Dude actually is, so you'll need to do some digging on his whereabouts.

Considering that there are no friendly forces nearby, we need to get creative. You'll drop from C-17 from low altitude using LAPES procedure, and proceed to secure nearby airfield. In the meantime, C-17s will go back for the remaining supplies that will be used to prepare FOB on the airfield.

After arresting Dude, go back to planes and evacuate ASAP.
